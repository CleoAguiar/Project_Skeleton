# Project Skeleton
It will have your project
layout, automated tests, modules, and install scripts. When you go to make a new project, just copy this
directory to a new name and edit the files to get started

```
skeleton /
	NAME/
		_ _i ni t _ _ . py
	bin /
	docs /
	setup . py
	t e s t s /
		NAME_tests . py
		_ _i ni t _ _ . py
```


## Using the Skeleton

1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename (move) the NAME directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call
your root module.
3. Edit your setup.py to have all the information for your project.
4. Rename tests/NAME_tests.py to also have your module name.
5. Double check itâ€™s all working by using nosetests again.
6. Start coding
